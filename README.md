Gesture Recognition

## Objective
As a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. We want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. 

There are 5 different actions
* Thumbs up :  Increase the volume
* Thumbs down : Decrease the volume
* Left swipe : Move backward 10 seconds
* Right swipe :  Move forward 10 seconds
* Stop : Pause
